    <h1><b><i><u> Newton's laws of motion </u></i></b></h1>
    <p> Newton's first law states that, <blockquote> An object remains in its state of rest or uniform motion unless it is acted on by a resultant force. </blockquote></p>
    <p> Newton's second law states that, <q> When a resultant force acts on an object, it accelerates in the direction of the force. </q></p>
    <p> Newton's third law states that, <blockquote><q> To every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction. </q></blockquote></p>
